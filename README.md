# 2 What is Booting?
Booting is the process of starting a computer. When you switch on your computer, the system loads the operating system (like Windows or Linux) from the hard drive into the RAM (memory), so you can use the computer.
---
Booting Process :
Power On â€“ You turn on the computer. POST (Power-On Self-Test) â€“ System checks hardware (RAM, keyboard, etc.). BIOS/UEFI Loads â€“ Basic system firmware starts. Boot Loader Activated â€“ BIOS/UEFI finds and runs the boot loader. OS Loading â€“ Boot loader loads the operating system into RAM. System Ready â€“ Operating system starts, and the computer is ready to use.

Types of Booting:
Cold Booting (Hard Booting):
Happens when the computer is started from the power-off state. Example: You press the power button to turn on your PC.
---
Warm Booting (Soft Booting):
Happens when the system restarts without turning off the power. Example: You click Restart or press Ctrl + Alt + Del.
